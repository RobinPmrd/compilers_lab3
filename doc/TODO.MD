## Report

- derive the Shift/Reduce Automaton for a given language:
  1. Constructing the state diagram with the closures inside the states and indicating the reductions at the states it applies.
  2. Renaming the states with numerical values 1, 2, and so on.
  3. Providing the table for the Shift/Reduce Automaton.

## Code

- implement the automaton in C.
- src/utilsFiles:
  - change utils files to adapt it for this lab (output name, blabla)
- main.c:
  - change main to adapt it for this lab
